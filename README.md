# Hello folks, I'm Andrea! 👋

🖥️ I'm a Software Engineer passionate about building scalable web applications, cloud solutions, and solid software architecture.

💡 I believe in a pragmatic approach to technology, a means to solve real-world problems, not an end in itself. To me, programming languages are tools, each with its own philosophy, strengths, and quirks. I enjoy adapting to their mindset rather than following them dogmatically.

🚀 I'm always eager to learn, refine development processes, and collaborate within Agile teams. When I can, I love contributing to open-source projects.
